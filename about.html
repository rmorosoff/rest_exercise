    <p>Rudy moved to the Seattle area over 3 years ago. That doesn't sound like a very long time, but Rudy sure does like to eat and drink.
      As such, he has managed to try many of the dining and libation establishments in the Seattle area. Opinions are like assholes, everybody
      has one. But please do try out Rudy's recommendations and see if you agree with some, or all, of his opinions. </p>
